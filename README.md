# ITAcademy_Hometasks

This repository contains hometasks for IT Academy iOS Development course starting from second part of Swift Syntax (9 lecture).

Each and every homework will be in separate branch named accordingly (eg: `homeTask9`, `homeTask10` etc.).

To complete the task do the folowing steps:
1. Create new branch in your own repository (eg. `homeTask9`)
2. Create playground and copy-paste task from the appropriate branch of the ITAcademy_Hometasks repository.  
3. Create new branch where you are going to solve task (eg. `homeTask9Solution`)
4. When task is completed, create pull request from solution branch (`homeTask9Solution`) to the task branch (`homeTask9`)
